This project showcases basic HTML abilities such as:
- Tags (html, head, body, headers, links, img, lists)
- Attributes
- File directories

Having to code the boilerplate multiple times with the tags, attributes, and varying contents helped me to remember what had to be typed to make a basic webpage using HTML.
